# ASBD Course Labs

This repository contains lab assignments for the ASBD (Applied Statistics and Big Data) course.

## Structure

The repository is organized by lab assignments:

### LAB02
- Data visualization exercises using various chart types (Area, Bar, Doughnut, Histogram, etc.)
- Uses Iris dataset for analysis
- Each question is in a separate directory with input and output folders

### LAB03
Various statistical visualization assignments including:
- Histogram analysis
- Stem and leaf plots
- Density plots
- Scatter plots
- Box and Swarm plots
- Violin plots
- Radar charts
- Funnel charts
- Correlation analysis

### LAB04
Data processing and analysis assignments:
- Data normalization
- Avocado price analysis
- Includes modular code structure with separate source and data directories

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```

## Running the Code

Each lab assignment contains separate Python scripts that can be run independently. Navigate to the specific lab directory and run the Python scripts:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Directory Structure

- Each lab has its own directory
- Input data is stored in `input/` or `data/` directories
- Output files (plots, tables) are saved in `output/` directories
- Source code is organized in modular structure where applicable

## Output

The scripts generate various visualizations and analysis results that are saved in the respective output directories.
